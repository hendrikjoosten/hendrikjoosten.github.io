Look, pandas is awesome, but let’s not kid ourselves—sometimes your data is just too big for one machine. The cool thing? The pandas ecosystem is growing up fast. Tools like Dask let you scale your pandas code without rewriting everything from scratch. I tried this last month on a gnarly dataset, and it was a game changer.

Check this out:

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

df = dd.read_csv('bigdata/*.csv')
# Do your usual pandas magic, but at scale!
df = df[df['status'] == 'active']
result = df.groupby('category').amount.sum().compute()
print(result)
```

If you’re still running pandas on a single laptop in 2025, you’re missing out. The future is distributed, and pandas is coming along for the ride. Don’t sleep on this stuff!
